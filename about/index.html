        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="yapping-session">
            <p>My name is <strong>Hanifa Al Fatih</strong> and I am a student in the FKIP English Education program at Sriwijaya University. I am currently learning stuff about web development. I have basic skills in HTML and CSS. although not really much that i know about it, i'm still able to start a project based of HTML and CSS. I am also interested in learning more about JavaScript and front-end development. But for now i will stick to HTML and CSS based projects until i fully understand and know every basics without any help.</p>
            <p>In addition, I am also quite passionate about photography. my main photography style is nature and street but it's nature most of the time. beside photography, i also have interest in gaming, gym, audiophiles, and tech related stuff. the reason why i have so many interest is because i always eager to try new things, whether in technology, nature exploration, fitness, or photography. it's all worth to try for me!</p>
            <p>I am the type of person who accepts criticism openly and evaluates myself based on it. Although this may cause me to overthink at times, it never brings me down because I am eager to learn from my mistakes and care deeply about what others think of me. Some criticism may hurt my feelings if delivered harshly, but itâ€™s not a major issue for me. I believe that if someone gives me criticism in such a way, there must be something I need to improve on.</p>

        <div class="yapping-session">
            <a href="https://ftxslyr.github.io/old-project/Tugas/">Portofolio 1 : Website List Tugas</a>
            <p>This is my first project on my highschool day. the code for the design was not fully original made by me. i found the code on youtube video explain on how to make a responsive web design so that it can be accessed from mobile without having any visual issue.</p>

            <a href="https://ftxslyr.github.io/old-project/Tugas/">Portofolio 2 : Personal Website</a>
            <p>This is my first and latest project after i got accepted in Sriwijaya University. this idea of making website coming from my friends link tree and personal portofolio website but it was made using template website and not coded by herself. it's more like a link hub to centralize her creative work and social media in one place. at that time i was also trying to code using linux mint because i need a good performance so it doesn't slow down my progress</p>
